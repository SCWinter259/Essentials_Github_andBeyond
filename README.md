# Essentials_Github_andBeyond

This is basically a Github repo to write down the core, basics of using Git/Github so that I won't forget.
I'm also writing down how to make and use markdown files and stuff. Anyways, not much to write about. I myself
am not sure about all of the contents included.

## Current contents
- ***UseMarkDown.md***: Basic markdown syntax for .md files
- ***Git_Github_procedure***: Basic procedure for using git and github
- ***Cool_git***: Some other git/github commands that I think are cool
- ***BashCommands***: Basic commands for using Linux
- ***MakeFileLines***: How to write a makefile, basic and a bit advanced
